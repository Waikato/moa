/**
 * A class representing a KDTree node. A node does not explicitly
 * store the instances that it contains. Instead, it only stores 
 * the start and end index of a portion in a master index array. Each
 * node is assigned a portion in the master index array that stores 
 * the indices of the instances that the node contains. Every time a 
 * node is split by the KDTree's contruction method, the instances of 
 * its left child are moved to the left and the instances of its 
 * right child are moved to the right, in the portion of the master 
 * index array belonging to the node. The start and end index in each
 * of its children are then set accordingly within that portion so 
 * that each have their own portion which contains their instances.   
 * P.S.: The master index array is only stored in KDTree class.
