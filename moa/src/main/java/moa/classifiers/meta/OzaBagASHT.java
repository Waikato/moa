/**
 * Bagging using trees of different size.
 * The Adaptive-Size Hoeffding Tree (ASHT) is derived from the Hoeffding Tree
 * algorithm with the following differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li> it has a maximum number of split nodes, or size
 * <li> after one node splits, if the number of split nodes of the ASHT tree
 * is higher than the maximum value, then it deletes some nodes to reduce its size
 * </ul>
 * The intuition behind this method is as follows: smaller trees adapt
 * more quickly to changes, and larger trees do better during periods with
 * no or little change, simply because they were built on more data. Trees
 * limited to size s will be reset about twice as often as trees with a size
 * limit of 2s. This creates a set of different reset-speeds for an ensemble of such
 * trees, and therefore a subset of trees that are a good approximation for the
 * current rate of change. It is important to note that resets will happen all
 * the time, even for stationary datasets, but this behaviour should not have
 * a negative impact on the ensemble’s predictive performance.
 * When the tree size exceeds the maximun size value, there are two different
 * delete options: <ul>
 * <li> delete the oldest node, the root, and all of its children except the one
 * where the split has been made. After that, the root of the child not
 * deleted becomes the new root
 * <li> delete all the nodes of the tree, i.e., restart from a new root.
 * </ul>
 * The maximum allowed size for the n-th ASHT tree is twice the maximum
 * allowed size for the (n-1)-th tree. Moreover, each tree has a weight
 * proportional to the inverse of the square of its error, and it monitors its
 * error with an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) with alpha = .01.
 * The size of the first tree is 2.
 * <br/><br/>
 * With this new method, it is attempted to improve bagging performance
 * by increasing tree diversity. It has been observed that boosting tends to
 * produce a more diverse set of classifiers than bagging, and this has been
 * cited as a factor in increased performance.<br/>
 * See more details in:<br/><br/>
 * Albert Bifet, Geoff Holmes, Bernhard Pfahringer, Richard Kirkby,
 * and Ricard Gavaldà. New ensemble methods for evolving data
 * streams. In 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge
 * Discovery and Data Mining, 2009.<br/><br/>
 * The learner must be ASHoeffdingTree, a Hoeffding Tree with a maximum
 * size value.<br/><br/>
 * Example:<br/><br/>
 * <code>OzaBagASHT -l ASHoeffdingTree -s 10 -u -r </code>
 * Parameters:<ul>
 * <li>Same parameters as <code>OzaBag</code>
 * <li>-f : the size of first classifier in the bag.
 * <li>-u : Enable weight classifiers
 * <li>-e : Reset trees when size is higher than the max
 * </ul>
