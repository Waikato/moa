DEFINITION A micro-clusterfor a set of d-dimensionalpoints Xi,. .Xi,
with t i m e s t a m p s ~. . .T,, is the (2-d+3)tuple (CF2", CFlX CF2t, CFlt, n),
wherein CF2" and CFlX each correspond to a vector of d entries. The definition of each of these entries is as follows:

o For each dimension, the sum of the squares of the data values is maintained
in CF2". Thus, CF2" contains d values. The p-th entry of CF2" is equal to
\sum_j=1^n(x_i_j)^2

o For each dimension, the sum of the data values is maintained in C F l X .
Thus, CFIX contains d values. The p-th entry of CFIX is equal to
\sum_j=1^n x_i_j

o The sum of the squares of the time stamps Ti,. .Tin maintained in CF2t

o The sum of the time stamps Ti, . . .Tin maintained in CFlt.

o The number of data points is maintained in n.
