/**
 * Adaptive Size Hoeffding Tree used in Bagging using trees of different size.
 * The Adaptive-Size Hoeffding Tree (ASHT) is derived from the Hoeffding Tree
 * algorithm with the following differences:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it has a maximum number of split nodes, or size
 * <li>after one node splits, if the number of split nodes of the ASHT tree is
 * higher than the maximum value, then it deletes some nodes to reduce its size
 * </ul>
 * The intuition behind this method is as follows: smaller trees adapt more
 * quickly to changes, and larger trees do better during periods with no or
 * little change, simply because they were built on more data. Trees limited to
 * size s will be reset about twice as often as trees with a size limit of 2s.
 * This creates a set of different reset-speeds for an ensemble of such trees,
 * and therefore a subset of trees that are a good approximation for the current
 * rate of change. It is important to note that resets will happen all the time,
 * even for stationary datasets, but this behaviour should not have a negative
 * impact on the ensemble’s predictive performance. When the tree size exceeds
 * the maximun size value, there are two different delete options:
 * <ul>
 * <li>delete the oldest node, the root, and all of its children except the one
 * where the split has been made. After that, the root of the child not deleted
 * becomes the new root
 * <li>delete all the nodes of the tree, i.e., restart from a new root.
 * </ul>
 * The maximum allowed size for the n-th ASHT tree is twice the maximum allowed
 * size for the (n-1)-th tree. Moreover, each tree has a weight proportional to
 * the inverse of the square of its error, and it monitors its error with an
 * exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) with alpha = .01. The size of the
 * first tree is 2. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * With this new method, it is attempted to improve bagging performance by
 * increasing tree diversity. It has been observed that boosting tends to
 * produce a more diverse set of classifiers than bagging, and this has been
 * cited as a factor in increased performance.<br/>
 * See more details in:<br/>

 * Albert Bifet, Geoff Holmes, Bernhard Pfahringer, Richard Kirkby, and Ricard
 * Gavaldà. New ensemble methods for evolving data streams. In 15th ACM SIGKDD
 * International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2009.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The learner must be ASHoeffdingTree, a Hoeffding Tree with a maximum size
 * value.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Example:<br/>
 * <br/>
 * <code>OzaBagASHT -l ASHoeffdingTree -s 10 -u -r </code> Parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Same parameters as <code>OzaBag</code>
 * <li>-f : the size of first classifier in the bag.
 * <li>-u : Enable weight classifiers
 * <li>-r : Reset trees when size is higher than the max
 * </ul>
