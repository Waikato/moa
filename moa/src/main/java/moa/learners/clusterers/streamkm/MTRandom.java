 * @author David Beaumont, Copyright 2005
 *         <p>
 *         A Java implementation of the MT19937 (Mersenne Twister) pseudo random
 *         number generator algorithm based upon the original C code by Makoto
 *         Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura (see
 *         <a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html">
 *         http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html</a> for more
 *         information.
 *         <p>
 *         As a subclass of java.util.Random this class provides a single
 *         canonical method next() for generating bits in the pseudo random
 *         number sequence. Anyone using this class should invoke the public
 *         inherited methods (nextInt(), nextFloat etc.) to obtain values as
 *         normal. This class should provide a drop-in replacement for the
 *         standard implementation of java.util.Random with the additional
 *         advantage of having a far longer period and the ability to use a far
 *         larger seed value.
 *         <p>
 *         This is <b>not</b> a cryptographically strong source of randomness
 *         and should <b>not</b> be used for cryptographic systems or in any
 *         other situation where true random numbers are required.
